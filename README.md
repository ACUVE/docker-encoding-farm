FFMPEG for Docker
=================

This repo has a Dockerfile to create a Docker image wth FFMPEG. It compiles
FFMPEG from sources following instructions from the
[Ubuntu Compilation Guide](http://ffmpeg.org/trac/ffmpeg/wiki/UbuntuCompilationGuide).

This image can likely be used as a base for a networked encoding farm.
